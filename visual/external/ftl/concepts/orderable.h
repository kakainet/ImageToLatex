	 *

	 *
	 * More formally, there must exist an `operator==` and an `operator!=` that
	 * both accept two objects of the type in question and returns either a
	 * `bool` or something contextually convertible to the same.
	 *
	 * Further, both comparison operators must be
	 * - Commutative: `a == b` implies `b == a`
	 * - Transitive: `a == b` and `b == c` implies `a == c`
	 *

	 * Note that the 'less than' and 'greater than' operators must evaluate

	 * following:
	 * - `a < b` implies `b > a`
	 * - `a > b` implies `b < a`
