	 * The lazy data type.
	 *
	 * Wraps a value of type `T`, causing its evaluation to be deferred until
	 * such a time as it is required.
	 *
	 * To reduce the number of times a particular computation is made, copies
	 * (as created by e.g. the copy constructor) of a particular `lazy` all
	 * refer to a shared object representing either the computed value, or the
	 * computation that will yield the value. Hence, the computation will only
	 * be made _once_ for every set of copies ultimately derived from the same
	 * source.
	 *
	 * If no instance of a particular computation ever forces it, then it simply
	 * won't be evaluated at all.
	 *
	 * As a convenience, there is a specialisation of `lazy` for `bool` that
	 * allows contextual conversions of `lazy<bool>` to `bool`, allowing
	 * expressions such as `if(lazyBool) doSomething();`. This will force
	 * evaluation.
	 *
	 * \note Lazy values are immutable. Bypassing this with some creative
	 *       casting may result in undefined behaviour.

	 * - \ref movecons
	 * - \ref assignable (note that assigning to a `lazy` does not change or
	 *        force the underlying computation, it merely changes _what_
	 *        computation that particular `lazy` encapsulates.
	 * - \ref deref to `T` (_forces_ evaluation).
	 * - \ref functor
	 * - \ref applicative
	 * - \ref monad
