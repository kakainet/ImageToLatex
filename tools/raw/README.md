# latex_expression_generators

a random latex expression generators, with various syntactic levels 
and conspects describing exact behaviour within the level

## task goal

create a set of generators capable of supplying the model with properly generated random latex expressions,   
matching strict expectations, for training purposes

## task state

- [x] __L1__: variables, integers and floats, brackets, arithmetics, fractions
  - [x] __L1:1__: nested fractions with positive and negative integer arithmetic
  - [ ] __L1:2__: ...  
  
  ...
